         This part looks like a lot of code but really what the first parameter is is just the url, the second is the method which type of request we are making which is a "POST" request which tells the server that we are sending information (clien id and secret) rather than asking for some, the third is parameters which are the information we are sending the server, the fourth is encoding which is the format in which we are sending the information, and then headers are nil because we don't have any. Then once we send the request the server sends back some information which we store in "response".
